# Evaluating Optimal Techniques for Data Fitting and Forecasting: Identifying the Best Approach for Accurate Predictions
In numerous domains, from energy management and finance to healthcare and engineering, the precision of data fitting and forecasting is paramount. Developing models that accurately predict future trends or fit historical data necessitates the selection of techniques tailored to the specific characteristics of the dataset. This research focuses on assessing optimal techniques for data fitting and forecasting through a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), VarianceCovariance Analysis, Linear Regression, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Time Series Analysis, and Neural Networks with varying activation functions, neurons, and layers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) offers foundational insights into the datasetâ€™s structure, enabling the identification of patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables. It represents the initial step in ensuring data readiness for advanced modeling techniques [1].
Variance-Covariance Analysis measures relationships and dependencies among variables, facilitating the selection of critical predictors and minimizing data redundancy [2].
Traditional Linear Regression serves as a baseline model, providing interpretability and efficiency for datasets exhibiting linear relationships. However, for datasets requiring dimensionality reduction or optimization of computational efficiency, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized to identify dominant patterns while reducing noise [3].
Time Series Analysis is particularly beneficial for datasets with sequential dependencies, capturing trends and seasonality to forecast future values [4]. For more complex and nonlinear relationships, Neural Networks offer a robust framework, especially when employing different activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) and experimenting with varying numbers of neurons and layers to enhance predictive accuracy [5].
This study evaluates each technique individually and compares hybrid models, such as integrating time series models with neural networks and autoregressive methods. The objective is to identify the best-performing approaches in terms of accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency, contributing to the ongoing exploration of data-driven decision-making strategies in real-world applications.
